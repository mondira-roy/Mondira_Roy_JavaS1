**Instructions**

Again, now it's your turn to implement your newly created interface, `Auditable`. 

1. Create a new class called `SchoolRecord` that implements `Auditable`.
1. The `runAudit()` method should simply print the word “auditing” to the console.
1. The `sendAuditToState()` method should simply print a confirmation message to the console.

Note: We'll be implementing actual functionality to the methods `runAudit()` and `sendAuditToState()` later. But for now just make sure that you understand how to add code to those individual methods!
