**Instructions**

1. Create the interface, `Storable()`.
1. `Storable()` should take two methods, `storeData()` and `retrieveData()`. Both methods should return nothing and take no parameters.
1. Then add it to the list of interfaces the ```SchoolRecord``` implements.

Hint: If you a compiler error occurs, remember that you need to provide the implementations the ```Storable()``` methods!
