     Shapes and Parameters

For the initial part we have 3 classes with the parent class Shape .  So Square, Circle and Triangle extends the class Shape.
All the private variables that are defined in the Square, triangle and Circle class and their getters and setters are set.
 We define a default constructor for each of the classes.
An interface was also defined in class but we had to use an abstract class.

Abstract class in Java is similar to interface except that it can contain default method implementation. An abstract class can have an
 abstract method without body and it can have methods with implementation also. So using an abstract class, we could pass the parameters.
